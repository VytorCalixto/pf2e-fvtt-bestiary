# PF2E Bestiary Data

This is a simple attempt to parse the foundryvtt PF2E compendium data into the format that I use for my applications. This is a work in progress and will be updated as I have time to work on it.

Instead of using individual files for each entry, I have decided to use a single file for each book. This is to reduce the number of files that need to be loaded and to make it easier to manage the data.
